\subsection*{Profile}

I’m a versatile full-stack developer with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, following a successful transition from a 7-year career as a teacher. I have 1.5 years of software development experience in the asset management sector, where I built and maintained web applications using C\#\, .NET, Angular, TypeScript, and Playwright. I've also developed solid experience working with SQL databases and deploying cloud services on Microsoft Azure. I bring strong communication, problem-solving, and collaborative skills, and I’m passionate about delivering clean, well-tested, and scalable solutions across the full development stack.

I passed my apprenticeship in March 2025, and took a short, planned career break to welcome and care for my new child. I am now fully available to re-enter the workforce and commit to my next role.
